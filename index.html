			<p>there's something wrong with the vessel - <br>
				the one you are driving.<br>
				acting up, breaking down, refusing to start <br>
				should you look under the hood? <br>
				<br>
				scared? - let someone else do it. <br>
				but there are no mechanics - <br>
				none for your vessel... <br>
				<br>
				...and that's how it should be. <br>
				open your vessel, thread your hands<br>
				around the cylinders until <em>your hands</em><br>
				are coated in gunk. <br>
				chunks of your younger self <br>
				make you drunk with sadness - <br>
				but don't cry. <br>
				<br>
				you have so much to learn, it seems. <br>
				you know less now <br>
				than you did back then, it seems. <br>
				when the world was small, <br>
				or so it seemed. <br>

			<p>Days complete themselves, pastel oils on wet canvases.<br>
				They fill themselves slowly, blots on every spot, <br>
				nothing goes unnoticed.<br>
				<br>
				There is so little time.<br>
				The edges fill themselves while <br> I'm still in the center.<br>
				There is no ground, no center here, <br>only what once was.<br>
				<br>
				At least the sky looks nice. If only my arms <br>
				could branch off my body, into the sky - <br>
				I'd evaporate, body weight and all, <br>
				dissipating into the sky.</p>
			<p id="last-verse-pastel-poem">Pastel days <br>turn into a pastel daze.<br>
				While everything is pretty, <br>&nbsp none of it matters.<br>
				&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It's so beautiful.</p>
